## What is GeoScope Credit?

GeoScope Credit is a sophisticated location intelligence platform that analyzes business locations using Google Maps APIs and advanced mathematical algorithms. It generates a comprehensive **GeoScore (0-100)** that helps entrepreneurs, investors, and lenders make data-driven decisions about business locations.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Location Scoring** - Mathematical precision with transparent algorithms
- **Interactive 3D Maps** - Google Earth-style building visualization with 45° tilt views
- **Comprehensive Analytics** - Hourly traffic patterns and weekly trend analysis
- **Transit Analysis** - Public transportation accessibility scoring
- **Safety Assessment** - Crime risk and security infrastructure evaluation
- **Competition Analysis** - Market saturation and competitive landscape insights
- **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly across all devices
- **Edge Performance** - Sub-second response times with global CDN

## Scoring Algorithm
GeoScope uses a **weighted average** of four critical factors:

```
GeoScore = (FootTraffic × 30%) + (Safety × 20%) + (Competition × 25%) + (Accessibility × 25%)
```
### Scoring Factors

| Factor | Weight | Description | Calculation Method |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Foot Traffic** | 30% | Pedestrian activity and customer flow | Proximity-weighted analysis with exponential decay |
| **Safety Index** | 20% | Security and crime risk assessment | Positive factors vs risk factors with base score of 70 |
| **Competition** | 25% | Market saturation analysis | Multi-zone pressure calculation with distance weighting |
| **Accessibility** | 25% | Public transportation connectivity | Logarithmic scaling with transit variety bonus |

## Setup 

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Google Maps API key with enabled services
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sicaario/geoscope-credit.git
   cd geoscope-credit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
3. **Environment setup**
   
   Create `.env.local` in the root directory:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}
   ```
4. **Google Maps API setup**
   
   Enable these APIs in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API (New)
   - Geocoding API
   - Directions API

5. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
